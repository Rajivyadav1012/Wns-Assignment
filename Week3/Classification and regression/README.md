### Model Explainability - Classification

#### üåç Global Explainability

**1. Feature Importance**

Shows which features drive loan approval decisions across all applications.


*Top features: CIBIL Score, Income Annual, Loan Amount have highest impact*

---

**2. Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)**

Visualizes how each feature independently affects approval probability while averaging out other features.

![PDP - CIBIL Score](./classification_pdp_cibil.png)

*Shows approval probability increases sharply when CIBIL score exceeds 700*

![PDP - Income](./classification_pdp_income.png)

*Higher income correlates with higher approval probability*

**Key Insights:**
- CIBIL score > 750: ~85% approval probability
- Income > ‚Çπ50L: Significant increase in approval chance
- Loan amount impact is non-linear with approval

---

**3. Feature Interaction Strength**

Identifies which feature pairs have the strongest combined effect on predictions.

![Feature Interactions](./classification_feature_interactions.png)

*Interaction matrix showing feature pairs that matter most when combined*

**Top Interactions:**
- **CIBIL Score √ó Income**: Strongest interaction - high CIBIL + high income = best approval odds
- **Loan Amount √ó CIBIL Score**: Large loans need higher CIBIL scores
- **Assets √ó Income**: Asset value matters more for high-income applicants

---

#### üéØ Local Explainability

**1. LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**

Explains why a specific loan application was approved or rejected by showing which features contributed most to that decision.

**Example: Loan Application #1234**

![LIME Explanation - Approved](./classification_lime_approved.png)

*LIME explanation for an approved loan showing positive contributors*

**Interpretation:**
- **Green bars** (right): Features supporting approval
  - CIBIL Score = 778 (+0.35 probability)
  - Income = ‚Çπ96L (+0.28 probability)
  - Bank Assets = ‚Çπ80L (+0.15 probability)
- **Red bars** (left): Features opposing approval
  - Loan Amount = ‚Çπ2.99Cr (-0.12 probability)
- **Final Decision**: Approved (85% confidence)

---

![LIME Explanation - Rejected](./classification_lime_rejected.png)

*LIME explanation for a rejected loan showing negative contributors*

**Interpretation:**
- CIBIL Score = 580 (-0.42 probability) - Primary rejection reason
- Low income (-0.25 probability)
- High loan amount relative to income (-0.18 probability)
- **Final Decision**: Rejected (78% confidence)

---

**2. Counterfactual Explanations**

Shows the minimal changes needed to flip the decision from rejected to approved.

![Counterfactual Example](./classification_counterfactual.png)

*What-if scenario: Minimum changes to get loan approved*

**Counterfactual Analysis for Rejected Application #5678:**

| Feature | Current Value | Needed Value | Change Required |
|---------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| CIBIL Score | 580 | 720 | +140 points |
| Income Annual | ‚Çπ35L | ‚Çπ52L | +‚Çπ17L |
| Loan Amount | ‚Çπ85L | ‚Çπ60L | -‚Çπ25L (reduce by 29%) |

**Actionable Insights:**
- **Easiest path to approval**: Reduce loan amount to ‚Çπ60L (no other changes needed)
- **Alternative**: Improve CIBIL score to 720 + increase income to ‚Çπ52L
- **Business Use**: Suggest customers which factors to improve for future applications

---

### Key Findings - Classification

**Global Insights:**
1. CIBIL Score is the dominant predictor (45% importance)
2. Income and loan amount interaction determines risk assessment
3. Asset values provide secondary confirmation signals

**Local Insights:**
1. Individual predictions are interpretable with LIME showing exact feature contributions
2. Counterfactuals provide actionable feedback to rejected applicants
3. Model decisions align with business logic and risk principles

### Model Explainability - Regression

#### üåç Global Explainability

**1. Feature Importance**

Identifies which health factors most strongly influence premium pricing.

![Feature Importance](./regression_feature_importance.png)

*Age, chronic diseases, and surgeries are top premium drivers*

**Importance Ranking:**
1. Age (28%) - Primary driver
2. Number of Major Surgeries (22%)
3. Any Chronic Diseases (18%)
4. Blood Pressure Problems (12%)
5. Weight & BMI-related factors (10%)

---

**2. Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)**

Shows how premium changes with each feature independently.

![PDP - Age](./regression_pdp_age.png)

*Premium increases steadily with age, accelerating after 50*

![PDP - Surgeries](./regression_pdp_surgeries.png)

*Each additional surgery adds ~$3,500 to premium*

![PDP - Chronic Diseases](./regression_pdp_chronic.png)

*Chronic diseases add ~$6,200 to base premium*

**Key Insights:**
- **Age effect**: Linear until age 45, then exponential increase
- **Surgery impact**: Each surgery adds fixed premium increment
- **Chronic disease**: Single largest premium jump ($6K+)
- **Combined effect**: 60-year-old with 2 surgeries + chronic disease = $35K+ premium

---

**3. Global SHAP Summary**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values show both feature importance and directional impact across all predictions.

![SHAP Summary Plot](./regression_shap_summary.png)

*SHAP summary: Red dots (high feature values) push predictions higher/lower*

**Interpretation:**
- **Age**: Red dots (older patients) consistently on right ‚Üí higher premiums
- **Surgeries**: More surgeries (red) ‚Üí higher premiums
- **Chronic Diseases**: Present (red) ‚Üí significantly higher premiums
- **Feature spread**: Wide distribution shows high individual variation

---

![SHAP Dependence Plot - Age](./regression_shap_dependence_age.png)

*SHAP dependence: Shows exact premium impact per age value*

**Reading the plot:**
- X-axis: Age values
- Y-axis: SHAP value (premium change from baseline)
- Each dot = one customer
- Curve shows non-linear relationship: steeper after age 50
