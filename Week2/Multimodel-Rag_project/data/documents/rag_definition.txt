Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI technique that combines external knowledge retrieval with a generative model to improve accuracy.

Key Points about RAG:
1. Retrieval: RAG retrieves relevant documents, passages, or knowledge from an external source such as a vector database or search engine.
2. Augmentation: The retrieved content is provided as context to the generative model.
3. Generation: The generative model (e.g., LLM) uses both the user query and the retrieved knowledge to generate more accurate and grounded responses.
4. Benefits: Improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and allows domain-specific knowledge integration.

Example:
If you ask a RAG system, "What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?", the system first searches its document store for definitions of RAG, then uses that content to generate a clear and accurate answer.
